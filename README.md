# Java Data Structures & Algorithms
Welcome to my Java Data Structures and Algorithms repository! This project includes implementations of 
various data structures and algorithms in Java, intended to provide a hands-on approach to learning fundamental concepts in computer science.

## Introduction
This repository contains a collection of fundamental data structures and algorithms implemented in Java. 
It is designed to serve as a practical guide for learning, experimenting with, and understanding different concepts in computer science.

### Implemented Data Structures
- `Array`: Basic array operations (insert, delete, search)
- `Linked` List: Singly and Doubly Linked Lists with common operations

### Implemented Algorithms
This repository also includes implementations of important algorithms like:

#### Sorting:
-`Bubble Sort`
